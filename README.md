## Extensions and Dev Environment

I recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) for development.

This project follows and enforces, using eslint, the [Prettier code formatting standards](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode). 
It is highly recommended to install that extension for easy code formatting.
